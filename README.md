# Example App
This repository contains Example App written in python programming language using flask framework of web development.

## Prerequisites
Below prerequisites must be fulfilled for successful execution of code.

### Software Requirement
Resources in this repository are meant for use with Python 3.x (check the version using `python3 --version`) and pip3 (check the version using `pip3 --version`). If you don't have the compatible version, download it from official python repository.

- [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.10.14
- [pip3](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) >= 23.0.1

### Bootstrap Virtual Environment
It is a best practice to create a virtual environment for your application to avoid any conflict in dependencies between multiple applications. Hence, it is recommended to create a virtual environment (using python's default package "venv" or of your choice) and install all the dependencies. Follow below according to your operating system.
```
Linux OS:
python3 -m venv example-app-venv
source example-app-venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Windows OS:
python -m venv example-app-venv
example-app-venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:**
- Activation makes the virtual environment the default Python interpreter for the duration of a shell session. Because, This will prepend that directory to your PATH, so that running python will invoke the virtual environmentâ€™s Python interpreter. As an indication of virtual environment activation, current shell prompt will prepend the name of the virtual environment you are currently using.

- To deactivate the environment, simply type `deactivate` and you will return to your normal shell.

- Within the virtual environment, you can use the command `pip` instead of `pip3` and `python` instead of `python3`.

## Run and Test the App on Local Machine
To start the web server of the app, execute the below command -
```
    python python/run.py
```

To check the webapp, open a browser and hit the below URL -
```
    http://<IP>:Port
    http://127.0.0.1:4999/
```

## Run and Test the App on Docker
1. Clone the repository and switch inside the directory.
2. Build the docker image using below command: 
```
    docker build . -t eapp:latest
```
3. To run the docker container from built image in the background with port mapping, use below command: 
```
    docker run -d -p 5000:4999 --name eapp-container eapp:latest
```
4. To test the app on host machine, open the browser or use curl command: 
```
    curl http://localhost:5000
```

**Note:** 
- . tells docker about the path of the Dockerfile.
- Port mapping is used to access the services running inside a Docker container. In the above case, we can now access the application using port 5000 on the host machine.
